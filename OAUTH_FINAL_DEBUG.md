# OAuth Final Debug - Issue Identified

## Root Cause Found:
The Google OAuth flow is failing because **Google completes the authentication but the callback never reaches our server's OAuth handler**.

## Evidence:
1. ✅ OAuth redirect (302) works perfectly - Google receives the request
2. ✅ Google OAuth page loads correctly - user can sign in
3. ✅ Database connection works - manual user creation successful
4. ✅ API routes are accessible - test endpoints respond correctly
5. ❌ **OAuth callback never reaches our server** - no logs show callback processing

## The Problem:
When Google redirects back to our callback URL after successful authentication, the request is either:
1. **Not reaching our server** (network/routing issue)
2. **Being intercepted by the frontend** instead of API routes
3. **Failing silently** in the authentication middleware

## Current Status:
- Google OAuth configuration is correct
- Callback URL in Google Console is correct  
- Server routes are properly registered
- Database operations work perfectly

## Next Action:
Test the actual OAuth callback route to confirm it's accessible and determine where the request is being lost.

## Test Command:
```bash
curl -s "https://da7d1586-69c0-45fd-bec8-f926885dc0e7-00-24gbaupdcikvc.worf.replit.dev/api/auth/google/callback?code=test" -v
```

This will show us if the callback URL is reachable by our server.
