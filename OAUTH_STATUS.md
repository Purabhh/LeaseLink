# OAuth Status Report

## Current Status: ✅ Almost Working

### What's Working:
- ✅ Google OAuth redirect (302) is successful
- ✅ Google sign-in page loads correctly  
- ✅ Callback URL is accessible and receiving requests
- ✅ Server receives OAuth callback requests

### The Issue:
Google completes the OAuth flow and calls back to our server, but the authentication process is failing silently. The user gets redirected back but remains unauthorized.

### Debugging Steps Taken:
1. Added detailed logging to OAuth callback
2. Fixed session configuration for OAuth compatibility
3. Verified callback URL accessibility 
4. Added CORS headers for OAuth flow

### Most Likely Causes:
1. **Database connection issue** - User creation/lookup failing
2. **Session persistence** - Session not being saved properly
3. **Google credentials mismatch** - Client ID/secret issues

### Next Steps:
1. Check database connectivity and user table
2. Verify Google OAuth credentials are correct
3. Test user creation process manually
4. Check session storage configuration

### Test Command:
```bash
curl -s "https://da7d1586-69c0-45fd-bec8-f926885dc0e7-00-24gbaupdcikvc.worf.replit.dev/api/auth/test-callback?test=true"
```

This should help us identify if the issue is with database, sessions, or OAuth configuration.
