# FINAL Vercel Deployment Fix

## Root Cause Identified:
The GitHub repository still doesn't have `@vitejs/plugin-react` in the package.json devDependencies, even after multiple commits.

## Current Status:
- ✅ Local Replit has `@vitejs/plugin-react` in devDependencies  
- ❌ GitHub repository is missing this dependency
- ❌ Vercel can't find the package during build

## Simple Solution:
Since git operations are restricted, I'll modify the vite.config.ts to use a standard Vite plugin that's already available.

## Alternative Approach - IMPLEMENTED:
✅ **Created simplified Vite config that doesn't require @vitejs/plugin-react**
- Uses Vite's built-in esbuild JSX transformation instead
- `vite.config.simple.ts` with `jsx: "automatic"` and `jsxImportSource: "react"`
- Build command copies simple config over original before building

## How it works:
1. Vercel runs: `cp vite.config.simple.ts vite.config.ts`
2. Then runs: `vite build --outDir dist/public`
3. Uses built-in JSX support instead of external plugin

## Benefits:
- No dependency on missing packages
- Same JSX compilation functionality
- Cleaner, simpler configuration
- Avoids Git sync issues completely
