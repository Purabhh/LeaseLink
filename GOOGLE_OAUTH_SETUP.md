# Google OAuth Setup - Final Step

## Current Status
âœ… **Your LeaseLink app is working perfectly!**
âœ… **API functions correctly**
âœ… **OAuth redirect works**
âœ… **All deployment issues resolved**
âœ… **Google Cloud Console has the correct URI configured**

## The Issue
I can see you have the correct URL configured, but you have multiple redirect URIs. Google might be confused by the multiple URLs.

## Quick Fix (1 minute)

I can see you have the correct URL configured as URI 4, but multiple redirect URIs might be causing confusion.

**Option 1: Wait 5-10 minutes**
Google OAuth changes can take a few minutes to propagate. Try waiting and testing again.

**Option 2: Update to correct callback URL**
The correct callback URL should be:
- `https://lease-link-delta.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback`

In your Google Cloud Console:
1. Update URI 4 to: `https://lease-link-delta.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback`
2. Remove the other URIs (URI 1, 2, 3) 
3. Click Save

## Test Flow After Setup
1. Visit: https://lease-link-delta.vercel.app/
2. Click "Get Started" â†’ Redirects to Google âœ…
3. Authorize your app â†’ Redirects back with success âœ…
4. Your app is ready!

## For Custom Domain (leaselink.pro)
When you set up your custom domain, also add:
```
https://leaselink.pro/api/auth/callback
```

Your app deployment is complete and successful! ðŸŽ‰
