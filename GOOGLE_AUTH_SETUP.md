# Google Authentication Setup Guide

## Current State
LeaseLink currently uses Replit's built-in authentication system which works seamlessly in the Replit environment.

## Switching to Google OAuth

### 1. Required Secrets
You would need to obtain these from Google Cloud Console:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

### 2. Google Cloud Console Setup
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
5. Set authorized redirect URIs:
   - Current Development: `https://da7d1586-69c0-45fd-bec8-f926885dc0e7-00-24gbaupdcikvc.worf.replit.dev/api/auth/google/callback`
   - Production: `https://your-domain.replit.app/api/auth/google/callback`

### 3. Code Changes Required

#### Install Additional Packages
```bash
npm install passport-google-oauth20 @types/passport-google-oauth20
```

#### Replace Authentication System
- Replace `server/replitAuth.ts` with Google OAuth implementation
- Update session management
- Modify authentication routes
- Update frontend authentication flow

### 4. Benefits of Google Auth
- Works across all platforms (not just Replit)
- Users can use existing Google accounts
- More familiar login flow for most users
- Better for production deployment

### 5. Considerations
- Requires additional setup and configuration
- Need to manage OAuth credentials securely
- More complex than current Replit auth
- Would need to test thoroughly across environments

## Implementation Steps

If you want to proceed with Google authentication, I can:

1. Create the Google OAuth setup
2. Replace the current authentication system
3. Update all authentication-related code
4. Test the new authentication flow

Would you like me to implement Google authentication for your app?
